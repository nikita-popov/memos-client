A standalone, offline-first note-taking app for Android with optional synchronization to [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) servers.

> **⚠ Work in Progress**  
> This project is in early development stage. Features are being actively developed and the API may change.

## Features

- **Fully Offline** - Works completely without internet connection or server
- **Optional Sync** - Connect to [Memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) server if you want cloud backup
- **Background Sync** - Automatic synchronization with Memos server using WorkManager
- **Modern UI** - Built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 design
- **Theme Support** - Light, dark, and system theme modes
- **Multi-Language** - Localization support

## Use Cases

### Standalone Mode

All your notes stay on your device.

### Sync Mode

Optionally connect to a **Memos** server to:
- Backup your notes to the cloud
- Sync across multiple devices
- Access notes from web interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikita-popov/memos-client.git
cd memos-client
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio Ladybug or later
3. Build and run the project on your device or emulator

### From Releases

Binary releases will be available soon

## Configuration

On first launch, you'll need to configure your Memos server connection:

1. Open Settings from the main screen
2. Enter your Memos server URL (e.g., https://memos.example.com)
3. Provide your authentication credentials
4. Save settings and sync will start automatically

## Known Issues
